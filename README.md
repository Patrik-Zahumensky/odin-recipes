# Odin Recipes

This repository contains a simple, yet informative website for a collection of delicious recipes. The website is built using HTML, demonstrating the ability to create a structured and organized webpage with proper headings, lists, links, and images. The project showcases the following skills:

- Basic HTML structure and organization
- Usage of different heading levels
- Implementation of ordered and unordered lists
- Embedding images into a webpage
- Creating links to navigate between pages
- Hosting a static website on GitHub Pages

The Odin Recipes project is divided into several iterations, each focusing on specific aspects of building a webpage. The final result includes a main index page, which serves as the homepage, and separate pages for each recipe. Each recipe page is structured with a descriptive header, an image of the finished dish, a brief description, a list of ingredients, and an ordered list of steps to prepare the dish.

Feel free to explore the recipes and get inspired to try them out for yourself!
