    <p>A Reuben sandwich is a delicious and savory grilled sandwich made with corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and Russian or Thousand Island dressing on rye bread. It's a quick and easy meal that pairs well with a pickle, potato chips, French fries, or classic deli sides like pasta salad, coleslaw, and tomato soup.</p>
